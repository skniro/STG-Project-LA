# ==============================================================
# 
# Click requirement information
# 
# You can now add 'click requirements' to left and right click commands!'
# These are defined per item and must follow a specific format:
# 
#   'item_one':
#     material: DIAMOND
#     slot: 3
#     left_click_commands:
#     - '[close]'
#     - '[message] You were charged 100 dollars for clicking that item!'
#     - '[console] eco take %player% 100'
#     left_click_requirement:
#       expression: '%vaulteco_balance% > 100'
#       deny_commands:
#       - '[close]'
#       - '[message] &cYou dont have 100 dollars to click that item'
#     right_click_commands:
#     - '[close]'
#     - '[message] You had permission to click that item!'
#     right_click_requirement:
#       expression: 'BukkitPlayer.hasPermission("some.permission.toclick")'
#       deny_commands:
#       - '[close]'
#       - '[message] &cYou dont have permission to click that item'
# 
# Every left/right_click_requirement MUST have an expression specified that would return a boolean (true/false)
# These expressions must also follow JavaScript format as they are all javascript based!
# 
# deny_commands: are optional and will be executed if the expression returns false.
# You may use placeholders in your Javascript expressions to evaluate if the player meets the requirement or not.
# You may also use a few keywords which give you access to the Player class and Bukkit.Server class if you understand the Bukkit API
# 
# BukkitPlayer - references the Player object your expression is evaluating.
# BukkitServer - references Bukkit.getServer() in the Bukkit API.
# 
# The choice to use this system to evaluate if a player meets requirements to click an item was an easy choice.
# This way I do not have to hook into every plugin to check if a player meets the requirement to click an item successfully.
# You can simply use placeholders, or the keywords provided to give you access to the Player and Server objects.
# If you want to check if a player has enough money, simply use an expression like so:
# 
# expression: '%vaulteco_balance% >= 100' (checks if players balance is greater than or equal to 100)
# If you want to charge the player, simply run the economy command to take the amount from the players balance in your click_commands
# which will be executed if the player meets the requirement!
# ==============================================================
# 
# View requirement information
# 
# You can add a 'view requirement' to an item if it has a priority value set for it
# The view requirement has replaced the 'permission' entry for items
# This allows you to specify a specific requirement in javascript for the item to be shown
# In order to use view requirements, the item must have a priority value and a valid javascript expression
# that returns true or false. 
# 
#   'item_one':
#     material: DIAMOND
#     slot: 3
#     priority: 1
#     view_requirement: '%vaulteco_balance% > 100'
#   'item_two':
#     material: IRON_INGOT
#     slot: 3
#     priority: 2
#     view_requirement: 'BukkitPlayer.hasPermission("some.permission")'
#   'item_three':
#     material: STONE
#     slot: 3
#     priority: 3
# 
# In the example above, the priority 1 item view requirement will be checked first, if a player has over 100 dollars, that item will be shown.
# If the player does not meet the requirement for the first item, the item with priority 2 will be checked. If the player does not have the permission
# node some.permission, the final item 'item_three' will be set to slot 3 as the player did not meet the requirement for the first 2 items with
# a higher priority.
# 
# You may use placeholders in your Javascript expressions to evaluate if the player meets the requirement or not.
# You may also use a few keywords which give you access to the Player class and Bukkit.Server class if you understand the Bukkit API
# 
# BukkitPlayer - references the Player object your expression is evaluating.
# BukkitServer - references Bukkit.getServer() in the Bukkit API.
# 
# The choice to use this system to evaluate if a player meets requirements to click an item was an easy choice.
# This way I do not have to hook into every plugin to check if a player meets the requirement to click an item successfully.
# You can simply use placeholders, or the keywords provided to give you access to the Player and Server objects.
# If you want to check if a player has enough money, simply use an expression like so:
# 
# view_requirement: '%vaulteco_balance% >= 100' (checks if players balance is greater than or equal to 100)
